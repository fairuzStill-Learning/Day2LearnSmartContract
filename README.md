# What I learn today?

**=>** Importing contract to another contract in the right way

**example :**

rather than do **import "./SimpleStorage.sol;"** this not wrong but, if i do this its gonna import all the contract in *SimpleStorage.sol*


do **import {name the spesific contract that i wanna import} from "./file name";**
this gonna be usefull if i have alot a contract in one file.


**=>** i think thats what i learned in day two. 


For day 3 I will relearn what I learned on day 1 and 2 because there is too much that I don't understand.
